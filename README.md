# Search Engine

An offline search engine that I built in Java for my Information Retrieval & Web Search course. This Search Engine can Parse, Index, Rank, and finally perform an efficient search for thousands of HTML webpages in a few seconds.

# What I learned 

* Built an inverted index
* Importance of ranking in a search engine.
* Techniques to improve speed and efficiency in a search engine.
* Dealt with complications of parsing searchable information from a few cluttered and unorganized HTML web pages. 

By uncommenting the test code in the backend.java file you can test how fast the search engine parses and indexes your files.
